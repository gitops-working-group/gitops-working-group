# Governance

This document defines the governance process for the GitOps Working Group and community.

## Membership

While anyone may join and contribute, voting members must be active members of the CNCF.
Apart from following the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), there are no special requirements.
This is an open public working group welcoming anyone who would like to help.
Feel free to register your interest in the [interested parties](interested-parties.md) document.

## Roles

### All Members

May either have no explicit roles or responsibilities, or formally assigned roles (see below).
May not create the impression that they have any authority or formal responsibilities within the GitOps WG other than their explicitly assigned roles.

### Chairs

The GitOps WG will be co-chaired by 3 people.
A maximum of one person from any one entity may hold a chair role at any given moment in order to avoid undue influence, and maintain balanced representation.
[Current chairs](#current-chairs) are listed in this this document.

Responsibilities:

- Primary role of Chairs is governance of the Working Group, who collectively care for the OpenGitOps project
- Ensure that meetings and other activities are conducted and progress continues to be made against the project agenda, while also engaging other group members in leadership roles
- Ensure discussion is extended asynchronously to be inclusive of members who cannot attend a specific meeting time
- Schedule discussion of proposals that have been submitted
- Partner with other WG members to establish a roadmap and manage ongoing projects
- Ask for new proposals to be made to address an identified needs
- Have GitOps domain knowledge
- Engage deeply in the work being done by the working group - that is, the role is not purely administrative.
  Chairs are, however not responsible for performing all of the work - this is shared across the working group members and expected from those who have volunteered onto various workstreams.
- When necessary, handle human and technical coordination across different working group workstreams

## Elections

[Chairs](#chairs) will be elected for one year terms and may run for reelection.

The election process takes place on the CNCF SIG App Delivery [mailing list](cncf-sig-app-delivery@lists.cncf.io ).

Before each election, there will be a call for nominiations on the mailing list.
Nominations should be sent to the mailing list, and include a brief bio and personal statement describing the candidates qualifications to serve in this capacity.
Self-nominations are welcome.

The GitOps WG employs "organization voting" to ensure no single organization can dominate the election process or project.
Each organization listed in the [interested parties](interested-parties.md) document has one vote.
Interested parties must be added at least one week before any election to have a vote.
Chairs will be elected using Ranked Choice Voting.

Election results will be announced on the mailing list, and current chairs listed in this document will be updated accordingly.

### Special Elections

There are several cases where positions are put up for unscheduled, special elections.

- Stepping down: If an elected chair steps down (or, in rare cases, is removed), a special election will be necessary to fill vacancies
- Change of affiliation: When affiliations of current chairs change – through job changes, mergers, etc. – and entity becomes overrepresented for a specific role, members of that entity will first be asked if they wish to resign their roles in order to remain within the allotment.
  If insufficient members resign their roles, the positions held by members associated with that entity will all be put up for a special election

In these cases, positions will be open both to previous holders and to any new nominees.
The standard nomination and [election](#elections) process will be carried out.
Representatives elected though this process will serve the remaining part of the current term.
