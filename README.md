The GitOps WG focus is to clearly define a vendor-neutral, principle-led meaning of GitOps, which will establish a foundation for interoperability between tools, conformance, and certification.
Lasting GitOps programs, documents, and code will live within the CNCF [OpenGitOps](https://github.com/open-gitops) project, also guided by the WG.

See the WG charter here: <https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery/blob/master/gitops-wg/charter.md>

## Principles

The GitOps Principles aim to give participants in the cloud native ecosystem a common understanding of GitOps systems based on shared principles, rather than individual opinion or implementation preference, as the foundation for GitOps practices.
