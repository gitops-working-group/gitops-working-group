# GitOps Working Group Charter

## Introduction

This document outlines the charter for the GitOps Working Group, a [time-limited Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/sigs/cncf-sigs.md#responsibilities--empowerment-of-sigs) under the [CNCF App Delivery SIG](https://github.com/cncf/sig-app-delivery).

## Mission Statement

The focus of the GitOps WG is to clearly define a vendor-neutral, principle-led meaning of GitOps.
This will establish a foundation for interoperability between tools, conformance, and certification. Lasting programs, documents, and code are planned to live within the [OpenGitOps](https://github.com/open-gitops) project.

## Cloud Native Alignment

The GitOps WG works to enable widespread and successful adoption of the GitOps pattern in cloud-native environments by:

- Providing valuable deliveries to the GitOps community, and objective information to CNCF TOC, End Users and Projects of the CNCF regarding areas considered in scope (see [goals](#goals) and [non-goals](#non-goals))
- Collaborating effectively with [other related groups](#other-related-groups)
- Helping to maintain the continued health of GitOps related projects in CNCF
- Identifying and filling gaps in the landscape of GitOps Projects

## SIG App Delivery Alignment

As an “operating model” for cloud native applications, GitOps fully aligns with "Application delivery workflow and strategy" and "Configuration source driven workflow" scopes defined in CNCF SIG App Delivery charter.

## Other Related Groups

- CNCF SIG-Security: Security in GitOps workflow is one of the most important areas in consideration
- CNCF SIG-Runtime: The execution engine of GitOps workflow is mostly a controller inside Kubernetes which drops in scope of SIG Runtime
- Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) cdCon GitOps Summit

## Goals

- Open governance
- Project/vendor neutral
- Create education materials and promote awareness and understanding of GitOps terminology and approaches
- Create documents and guidelines for following and implementing GitOps principles
- Impartial analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of GitOps and its various approaches
- Maintain a vendor-neutral landscape of GitOps projects/products and solutions

## Non-Goals

- Recommend/endorse specific projects, vendors or approaches to GitOps
- Exclude/deprecate specific projects, vendors or approaches to GitOps
- Promote GitOps over other paradigms or methodologies (i.e. no advocacy or branding)

## Governance

### Membership

Membership is self-declared.
There are no membership requirements to be a part of the GitOps WG.
This is an open public working group welcoming anyone who would like to help.

### Roles

#### All Members

May either have no explicit roles or responsibilities, or formally assigned roles (see below).
May not create the impression that they have any authority or formal responsibilities within the GitOps WG other than their explicitly assigned roles.

#### Chairs

The GitOps WG will be co-chaired by 3 people.
A maximum of one person from any one entity may hold a chair role at any given moment in order to avoid undue influence, and maintain balanced representation.
[Current chairs](#current-chairs) are listed in this this document.

Responsibilities:

- Primary role of Chairs is governance of the Working Group, who collectively care for the OpenGitOps project
- Ensure that meetings and other activities are conducted and progress continues to be made against the project agenda, while also engaging other group members in leadership roles
- Ensure discussion is extended asynchronously to be inclusive of members who cannot attend a specific meeting time
- Schedule discussion of proposals that have been submitted
- Partner with other WG members to establish a roadmap and manage ongoing projects
- Ask for new proposals to be made to address an identified needs
- Have GitOps domain knowledge
- Engage deeply in the work being done by the working group - that is, the role is not purely administrative.
  Chairs are, however not responsible for performing all of the work - this is shared across the working group members and expected from those who have volunteered onto various workstreams.
- When necessary, handle human and technical coordination across different working group workstreams

### Elections

[Chairs](#chairs) will be elected for one year terms and may run for reelection.

Chairs are selected by the members of the working group.

The election process takes place on the CNCF SIG App Delivery [mailing list](cncf-sig-app-delivery@lists.cncf.io ).

Before each election, there will be a call for nominiations on the mailing list.
Nominations should be sent to the mailing list, and include a brief bio and personal statement describing the candidates qualifications to serve in this capacity.
Self-nominations are welcome.

Any member may cast a vote.
To avoid having a single company dominate the election process, at most two votes from maintainers working for the same company will count.

Election results will be announced on the mailing list, and current chairs listed in this document will be updated accordingly.

#### Special Elections

There are several cases where positions are put up for unscheduled, special elections.

- Stepping down: If an elected chair steps down (or, in rare cases, is removed), a special election will be necessary to fill vacancies
- Change of affiliation: When affiliations of current chairs change – through job changes, mergers, etc. – and entity becomes overrepresented for a specific role, members of that entity will first be asked if they wish to resign their roles in order to remain within the allotment.
  If insufficient members resign their roles, the positions held by members associated with that entity will all be put up for a special election

In these cases, positions will be open both to previous holders and to any new nominees.
The standard nomination and [election](#elections) process will be carried out.
Representatives elected though this process will serve the remaining part of the current term.
