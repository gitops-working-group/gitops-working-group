# GitOps Working Group Charter

## Introduction

This document outlines the charter for the GitOps Working Group, a [time-limited Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/sigs/cncf-sigs.md#responsibilities--empowerment-of-sigs) under the [CNCF App Delivery SIG](https://github.com/cncf/sig-app-delivery).

## Mission Statement

The focus of the GitOps WG is to clearly define a vendor-neutral, principle-led meaning of GitOps.
This will establish a foundation for interoperability between tools, conformance, and certification. Lasting programs, documents, and code are planned to live within the [OpenGitOps](https://github.com/open-gitops) project.

## Goals

- Open governance
- Project/vendor neutral
- Create education materials and promote awareness and understanding of GitOps terminology and approaches
- Create documents and guidelines for following and implementing GitOps principles
- Impartial analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of GitOps and its various approaches
- Maintain a vendor-neutral landscape of GitOps projects/products and solutions

## Non-Goals

- Recommend/endorse specific projects, vendors or approaches to GitOps
- Exclude/deprecate specific projects, vendors or approaches to GitOps
- Promote GitOps over other paradigms or methodologies (i.e. no advocacy or branding)

## Work Products (WIP)

- GitOps definition and terminology document: working draft
- GitOps methodologies and approaches document
- GitOps landscape document
- Working examples for getting started

## Cloud Native Alignment

The GitOps WG works to enable widespread and successful adoption of the GitOps pattern in cloud-native environments by:

- Providing valuable deliveries to the GitOps community, and objective information to CNCF TOC, End Users and Projects of the CNCF regarding areas considered in scope (see [goals](#goals) and [non-goals](#non-goals))
- Collaborating effectively with [other related groups](#other-related-groups)
- Helping to maintain the continued health of GitOps related projects in CNCF
- Identifying and filling gaps in the landscape of GitOps Projects

## SIG App Delivery Alignment

As an “operating model” for cloud native applications, GitOps fully aligns with "Application delivery workflow and strategy" and "Configuration source driven workflow" scopes defined in CNCF SIG App Delivery charter.

- CNCF SIG-Security: Security in GitOps workflow is one of the most important areas in consideration
- CNCF SIG-Runtime: The execution engine of GitOps workflow is mostly a controller inside Kubernetes which drops in scope of SIG Runtime
